<p>
Jubliant Breeze ("Company", "we", "our", or "us") operates the mobile application (the "Service").
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, process, store, and protect user information when you use the Service.
</p>

<p>
By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Information We Collect</h2>

<p>
<strong>User-Provided Content:</strong>  
We collect content that you voluntarily provide when using the Service, including images, photos, and text prompts.
Uploaded images may contain a human face.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Important:</strong> We do <strong>not</strong> collect biometric identifiers, facial recognition data, facial templates, face geometry, or any data used to identify or verify a person’s identity.
</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Use of Face Data</h2>

<p>
Images that may include a human face are processed solely to provide the AI-powered image generation or editing features explicitly requested by the user.
</p>

<p>
We do <strong>not</strong> use face data for:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Facial recognition</li>
  <li>Identity verification</li>
  <li>User tracking</li>
  <li>Profiling or analytics</li>
  <li>Advertising or marketing</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="section-title">AI Processing and Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>
To deliver AI-based features, user-provided content (including images and prompts) is securely transmitted to third-party AI service providers for processing.
</p>

<p>
These third-party providers process data strictly to fulfill the requested functionality and are not permitted to use the data for advertising, training, or any other purpose beyond providing the service.
</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Data Storage and Retention</h2>

<p>
User-uploaded images and generated outputs are stored only temporarily.
</p>

<p>
All uploaded images, including images containing a human face, are automatically deleted from our servers within <strong>24 hours</strong> after processing or earlier once the output is delivered to the user.
</p>

<p>
We do not retain face data beyond the period necessary to provide the requested service.
</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Advertising</h2>

<p>
The Service may display advertisements provided by third-party advertising partners.
</p>

<p>
Advertisers do not receive access to user-uploaded images or face data. Face data is never shared for advertising purposes.
</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Data Security</h2>

<p>
We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect user data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.
</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Children’s Privacy</h2>

<p>
The Service is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Your Rights</h2>

<p>
You may stop using the Service at any time. Because uploaded images are automatically deleted within a short period, no long-term user data is retained.
</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
</p>
